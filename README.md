# CodeAlpha_Task3
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing:

About Me: Learn about my background and interests.
Projects: A collection of my notable projects with links to live demos or repositories.
Skills: A list of my technical skills in web development.
Contact: A form to send messages directly to me.
The website features a clean, responsive design with smooth scrolling functionality for seamless navigation.

Special thanks to the CodeAlpha team for their incredible support and inspiration in making this project possible.
